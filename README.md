FixMyMess

An AI-powered assistant to streamline your document revision workflow.

FixMyMess is a simple but powerful web tool that helps students, researchers, and professionals address feedback on their documents more efficiently. It extracts comments from .docx files, presents them in a clear interface, and uses AI to generate context-aware revision suggestions.
The Problem

The process of revising a document based on feedback is often fragmented and tedious. It typically involves:

    Jumping back and forth between comment bubbles and the main text.

    Manually copying and pasting text into a separate AI tool for help.

    Losing the overall context of the document, which leads to less relevant AI suggestions.

This breaks the flow of writing and makes the revision process slower than it needs to be.
How FixMyMess Solves It

FixMyMess creates a single, unified workspace for your revisions.

    Context is King: When you upload your document, the app reads the entire text to build a complete contextual understanding.

    Intelligent Extraction: It automatically pulls every comment and links it to the exact text it refers to.

    AI-Powered Suggestions: When you request a revision, the app sends the AI the supervisor's comment, the original text, and the full document context. This results in higher-quality, more relevant suggestions that match the tone and style of your work.

    Secure and Private: All file processing happens entirely in your browser. Your documents are never uploaded to a server, ensuring your work remains private.
