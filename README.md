# FixMyMess

**An AI-powered assistant to streamline your document revision workflow.**

## 🚩 The Problem

Revising documents based on feedback is often tedious and fragmented:

- Jumping between comment bubbles and the main text  
- Manually copying content into external AI tools  
- Losing overall context, resulting in irrelevant suggestions  

This breaks writing flow and slows down revisions.
